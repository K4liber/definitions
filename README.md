Hierarchy of precise definitions
`

## What?

First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there.

The most fundamental concepts make up the very bottom of the hierarchy of definitions. The ground level (zero level) definitios do not have any references to other definitions. The are purely describe without usage of other concepts. The higher a concept is places in the hierarchy the higher level definitions it can reference too. A definition can only reference to another definition from a lower level. Hierarchy of definitions has a structure of a tree.

## Why?

The target is to create a knowledge model when one can start learning from a foundamental concepts and climbing to higher level of hierarchy. Picking a single definition, the descendent nodes indicate what should be firstly understand to fully understand the chosen definition.

Over time, the tree can be updated with more precise and better placed definitions. It is a kind of living systematic review of a specific branch of knowledge.

Keeping the tree structure enforce us to build a definition on top of the more general concepts. It makes it clear how specific is the concept we try to define. Going down in the hierarchy we reach a low level definitions that are more general and fundamental. Climping up on the hierarchy tree we learn more specific, high level concepts.

The tree is going to be precise and well arranged knowledge structure. It can be used by humans and artificial intelligence systems as well.

## How?

It is a tedious process to create such knowledge structure since one need have a good undestanding of an abstraction level for each definition. AI language models can automate some part of a work. On the other hand, the creation process allows for a deep understanding of the concepts and their unambiguous definition.

Money is a universal motivator and it could be involved in the creation process as well. One of ideas to involve money in the process is inspired by the blockchain technology. A single block is an update to the existing knowledge structure (a single commit). It is not clear yet who is going to be the judge if a specific update request should be accepted or rejected.

One of the ideas is to involve the current stake/knowledge holders with something similar to the Proof-of-Stake. The benefits for the knowledge update can be splitted between author(s) and reviewer(s). Removing part of the content is going to be rewarded as well. The current idea for the creation process is following:

- create a PR with proposed changes (additions, removals)
- selection of reviewers based on the current involvment on the content similar to the proposed one
- voting/corrections from the reviewers
- (if voted on) final decision from the project maintainer
- (if accepted) new knowledge coins are generated for the block (commit)
- (if accepted) new knowledge coins split between author(s) and reviewer(s)

The are several issue to be solved before introducing such process:
- what is the minimum amount of contribution (size of a minimum block/commit)?
- should the amount of generated knowledge coins be proportional to the number of signs being changed? 
- how to reduce spam/garbage PRs (there could be too many of bad quality PRs due to AI tool capabilities)?
- how does a transaction of knowledge coins corresponds to the knowledge coin mining? Is the mining only triggered on an PR merge or on transactions as well?
